This project was born from personal experiences with the medical care system, where inefficiencies and lack of proper organization led to frustration and inadequate care. The app simulates a hospital management system designed to streamline patient, receipt, and department tracking.

Key features include:
-Searching for patients by name.
-Filtering lists for quick access to information.
-Adding, removing, and updating any entity with ease.

Beyond its functionality, this project also served as a learning journey. It provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaFX, Scene Builder, and the use of CSS for styling, enhancing both the appâ€™s appearance and user experience.
